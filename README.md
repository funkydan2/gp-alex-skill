# Gympie Presbyterian Alexa Skill

My first attempt to make a skill for Alexa.

The skill connects with an [Airtable](https://airtable.com) base to give information about the preaching program at [Gympie Presbyterian Church](https://gympiepresbyterian.org.au). It can play the latest [sermon](http://gympiepresbyterian.org.au/sermons/), and previous sermons using the *next* command.

In the future, I may add the ability to interact with [elvanto](https://elvanto.com) for rostering.
